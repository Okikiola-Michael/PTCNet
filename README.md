# PTCNet
Tree crown detection model based on YOLOv3


PTCNet is a deep-learning urban tree crown detector for our study area, developed on YOLOv3 architecture with a Darknet-53 backbone. Based on the test dataset, the model had >75% precision and 62% recall of ground-truth data. However, based on other scenario test data, the performance was higher. It was developed for a Pullman city located in the southeastern part of Washington.

PTCNet model files are in the trained model folder
The training and test annotation dataset ara in the hand-annotated annotations folder
The detected tree crowns are in the predicted annotation folder
