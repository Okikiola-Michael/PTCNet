[**PTCNet**]() is a deep-learning urban tree crown detector, developed on [__YOLOv3__](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767) architecture with a Darknet-53 backbone. 

```javascript
Model Training
1. Model: YOLOv3 with a Darknet-53 backbone for 30 epochs.
2. Batch: 8
3. IOU: 0.5 (Overlap between the reference and detected tree crowns)
4. Non-maximum suppression: 0.1
5. Confidence score: 0.1

```

Based on the test dataset, the model had `>75% precision` and `62% recall` of ground-truth data. However, based on other [scenario](https://github.com/Okikiola-Michael/PTCNet/blob/main/scenarios.zip) test data, the performance was higher. It was developed for the city of [Pullman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman,_Washington) located in the southeastern part of Washington. More information on the model can be found in our [publication](). The model will be continually updated to improve its generalization and localization, and the newer version will be uploaded.

The PTCNet model was trained using ArcGIS Pro 3.4, and the .dlpk files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1fmKsfo78rBHs5JBXQokD8GEc1ZOvt78t). 

The high-resolution RGB image used is [here](https://gis.pullman-wa.gov/portal/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=8149c19a386c42bd88d440af8dac195e) 

The training, testing, and scenario annotation shapefiles are here in the [`hand annotations`](https://github.com/Okikiola-Michael/PTCNet/tree/main/hand_annotations) folder.

The detected tree crown shapefiles are in the [`predicted annotation`](https://github.com/Okikiola-Michael/PTCNet/tree/main/predicted_annotations) folder.

The entire tree crown, including training/testing annotations, predicted annotations, and other annotations, is available [here]().
